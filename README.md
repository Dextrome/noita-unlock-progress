<h2>Console Application</h2>
<h3>About</h3>
This is a console app for windows which you can use to unlock all or some of the following things in Noita:

* Spell Cards ( Unlocks spells for spawning in-game )
* Perks Picked ( Used perk progress )
* Spell Actions ( Used spell progress )
* Enemies Killed ( Killed enemies progress ) <i>(only works through the in-game mod dextrome_unlock_everything for now)</i>
* Secrets ( Unlocks amulet, hat, etc... I'm not exactly sure what all the rest is used for )
* Misc Progress ( Orbs, mini-bosses, essences, endings, nohitrun, etc... )

<h3>Download</h3>

* You can download the repository and compile the executable in .NET Core

 <h3>dextrome_unlock_everything</h3>
 
 https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2790762892
 
 Permanently unlocks <b>everything</b> when starting a game with this mod enabled.

 For some reason these 5 spells can't be unlocked through the mod, but I have no idea why (works fine in the console app with same entity names):
* Summon Omega Blade
* Luminous Drill With Timer
* Homebringer Teleport Bolt
* Essence To Power
* Petrify
