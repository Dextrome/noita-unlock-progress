	name="Unlock Spells & Progress"
	description="This isn't an in-game mod, but I figured this was the best place to share it.

				This is a console app for windows which you can use to unlock all or some of the following things in Noita:[list]
				[*] Spell Cards ( Unlocks spells for spawning in-game )
				[*] Perks Picked ( Used perk progress )
				[*] Spell Actions ( Used spell progress )
				[*] Enemies Killed ( Killed enemies progress ) [i][b]-NOT IMPLEMENTED YET![/b][/i]
				[*] Secrets ( Unlocks amulet, hat, etc... I'm not exactly sure what all the rest is used )
				[*] Misc Progress ( Orbs, mini-bosses, essences, endings, nohitrun, etc... )[/list]

				You can download the executable [url=https://drive.google.com/file/d/12DaR5tmVsmzErLR6Lt1bjRrhHWpGjrOt/view?usp=sharing]here[/url] or [url=https://github.com/Dextrome/noita-unlock-progress/blob/master/steamworkshop/dextrome_unlock_progress/Noita-UnlockAllProgress.exe]here[/url]. 
				Or subscribe to this mod and look for the executable in ...\SteamLibrary\steamapps\workshop\content

				Source code can be found at https://github.com/Dextrome/noita-unlock-progress

				[b][u]Notes[/u][/b]: 
				[list][*] This app will never delete anything from your save folder, but it is advised to take a backup anyway
				[*] Still working on unlocking enemy progress, it's a bit more tricky than the other unlocks[/list]
