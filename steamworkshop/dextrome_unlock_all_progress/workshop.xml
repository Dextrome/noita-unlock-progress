	name="Unlock Spells & Progress"
	description="This isn't an in-game mod, but I figured this was the best place to share it.

				This is a console app for windows which you can use to unlock all or some of the following things in Noita:[list]
				[*] Spell Cards ( Unlocks spells for spawning in-game )
				[*] Perks Picked ( Used perk progress )
				[*] Spell Actions ( Used spell progress )
				[*] Enemies Killed ( Killed enemies progress ) [i][b]-NOT IMPLEMENTED YET![/b][/i]
				[*] Secrets ( Unlocks amulet, hat, etc... I'm not exactly sure what all the rest is used )
				[*] Misc Progress ( Orbs, mini-bosses, essences, endings, nohitrun, etc... )[/list]
